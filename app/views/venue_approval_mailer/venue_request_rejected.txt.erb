Hi <%= (@venue_request.requester_type == "owner" ? Owner.find_by(id: @venue_request.requester_id)&.email : Artist.find_by(id: @venue_request.requester_id)&.username) || "there" %>,

We reviewed your venue request for "<%= @venue_request.name %>" and unfortunately had to reject it.
<% if @notes.present? %>
Reason: <%= @notes %>
<% end %>

If you believe this was a mistake or you can provide additional documentation, just reply to this email.
