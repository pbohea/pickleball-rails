  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="muted">Effective date: <strong>October 8, 2025</strong></p>

  <p><strong>Pickleball</strong> respects your privacy. We collect only what we need to operate
  the app and website and we never sell your data.</p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Account data</strong> (e.g., email and password) to let you sign in.</li>
    <li><strong>Usage data</strong> (basic logs/analytics) to keep the service reliable.</li>
    <li><strong>Profile Picture</strong> (Artists only) to display your photo on your profile.</li>
    <li><strong>Notifications</strong>: if you enable push, we store a device token.</li>
    <li><strong>Owner verification uploads</strong> (utility bill/license) only when an owner
        submits a venue claim. These files are used solely to verify ownership and are deleted after
        the request is approved/rejected.</li>
    <li><strong>Location</strong> (if you grant permission) to show nearby venues/events in the app.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide and improve core features (accounts, events, artists, venues).</li>
    <li>Send notifications you opt into.</li>
    <li>Verify venue ownership for claims.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not sell your data. We use trusted service providers (cloud hosting,
  storage, email/push delivery, maps) who process data on our behalf to run Pickleball.</p>

  <h2>Data Retention</h2>
  <p>Account data is kept while your account remains active. Owner verification uploads are
  deleted once reviewed.</p>

  <h2>Your Choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You can request deletion of your account and associated data.</li>
    <li>You can disable notifications or location in your device settings.</li>
  </ul>
